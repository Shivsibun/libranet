LibraNet is a small Java console project that works like a library system. It can handle books, audiobooks, and e-magazinesUsers can borrow, 
return,search,and even donate items. The program also calculates late fines and shows availability of items.

#Extra Features
    - Added a donation option so users can contribute new books, audiobooks, or magazines.
    - Fine calculation for late returns.
    - Search option to filter by type.
    - Proper error handling for wrong inputs.

#Future Plans
    - In the future, I want to add a database to save data permanently, create a login system for users, and maybe design a simple 
      frontend so it looks more like a real application.
